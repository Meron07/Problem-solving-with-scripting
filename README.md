# Problem-solving-with-scripting

Project Overview
This project implements two Python applications demonstrating advanced scripting techniques:

Part I: CourierOptimizer
A smart courier routing system for NordicExpress delivery service in Oslo. The system optimizes delivery routes based on multiple criteria (time, cost, CO2 emissions) and supports different transport modes.

Part II: Conway's Game of Life
An interactive cellular automaton simulator with pattern loading, multiple rule sets, and dynamic metaprogramming features.

Features Implemented
Core Requirements
Modular design with functions and classes
File I/O operations (CSV, pattern files, logs)
Metaprogramming (decorators, dynamic class modification, rule registry)
Custom error handling with exception hierarchy
Regular expressions for validation and pattern parsing
pytest testing (comprehensive test suites)
Logging with structured output
CLI interfaces for both applications
